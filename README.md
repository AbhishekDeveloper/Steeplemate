## Front-end
 Using angular template(PrimeNg)[`https://www.primefaces.org/primeng/#/`].
 
## Get started
### Clone the repo
```shell
git clone https://github.com/AbhishekDeveloper/Steeplemate.git
cd Steeplemate
```
### Install npm packages
Install the `npm` packages described in the `package.json` and verify that it works:

```shell
npm install
npm start
```
The `npm start` command builds (compiles TypeScript and copies assets) the application into `dist/`, watches for changes to the source files, and runs `lite-server` on port `3000`.

Shut it down manually with `Ctrl-C`.
## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.




## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
